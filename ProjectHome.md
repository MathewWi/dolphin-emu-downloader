News 4/15/12: Thanks to @TheRacerMaster for the new image!

News 4/14/12: After hours of coding, I have added support for Ubuntu linux script. I plan to add support for other distributions in the near future. Grab the Linux Binary from the Downloads section and execute it in terminal with "perl dolphindown80.pl"

News 2/24/12: For those of you having trouble, I have updated the Wiki Page..

This is a perl script designed to run on mac, which will:

-Download/install dependancies for Dolphin

-Checkout newest revision of Dolphin

-And compile

Dolphin-emu ( http://dolphin-emu.com ) Which is an open source gamecube / wii / Triforce emulator.

So now everyone who wants to use dolphin on their mac, CAN!!

Can now do EVERYTHING for you, just install xcode and the nvidia cg toolkit and youre ready to go!
