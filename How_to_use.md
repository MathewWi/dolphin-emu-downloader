#Instructions

As of now, dolphin-emu-downloader can be a bit hard to use. Don't worry, it's still possible though!

Step 1. Download from the Downloads page

Step 2. If your browser did not already do this, Extract the zip file.

Step 3. Open Finder and open Applications>Utilities>Terminal, or search for Terminal in Spotlight

Step 4. Navigate to the directory you extracted dolphin-downloader in terminal.
Ex. If you extracted in your download Folder you would execute the following commands in Terminal (In Order):

cd Downloads
cd dolphin-(Press tab to complete folder name)

Step 5. Type "perl dolphindown.pl" (No quotes). If this does not work, type "cd dolphin(press tab to complete) && perl dolphin**.pl" (No quotes)**

Step 6. Enjoy!! Sorry this was so hard, I am working on a way to make it easier to use.
